        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 T Buter</li>
            <li>1 Lemon</li>
            <li>8 oz. Orzo</li>
            <li>Sm Yellow Onion (Or a shallot), diced</li>
            <li>4-5 oz. Pancetta/Guanciale</li>
            <li>1.2 C. Frozen Peas</li>
            <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>Salt, Black Pepper, Red pepper Flakes</li>
        </ul> 
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook Pancetta/Guanciale over medium in a small skillet until browned. Once cooked transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate and set aside. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, peel 3 strips from the lemon, zest the rest with a Microplane, then juice the lemon. Combine the zest and juice, place the strips with 1-2T of pepper, 1/2 t of red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Place 2T butter & 1T olive oil in a medium pot over medium-low until melted. Add the diced onion and saute until translucent but not browned.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon strips/pepper as well as a large pinch of salt. Cook for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Add the orzo and cook, stirring often, for 2-4 minutes. Don't rush this but watch for burning</li>
            <li>Add 1 1/2C of water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring/scraping often until the orzo is cooked and a nice sauce has developed.</li>
            <li>Run the peas under hot water in a colander to remove frost, add to pan in the last 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 2T butter, remove from heat and stir to combine. Slowly add grated parm until it is melted in and the mixture seems a bit too thick.</li>
            <li>Stir in the lemon juice, salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve with pancetta, more parm, more oil and some salt/pepper!</li>
        </ol>
